# 100-Days-of-Code-The-Complete-Python-Pro-Bootcamp
---
<p style = "text-align: justify;">*The following repository contains all of the projects that were developed all the way to complete <em><strong>Udemy's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</strong></em>, developed and taught by Dr. Angela Yu.
<bold>Considerations about the repository:</bold>

1. The course is divided into 100 days, or modules, which follow the way folders have been organized.
2. Each day's folder contains the activities and/or projects that correspond to each day.
3. From days 1-9, there are mostly small activities.
4. Days 1 and 2 were omitted due to the simplicity of those activities and modules.
5. Day 13 was omitted (not because 13 brings bad luck ðŸ˜…) because it was a debugging module, and contained simple debugging exercises to previous day's challenges.

> <em>Note: The status of the current Bootcamp is still <bold>In Progress</bold>, so new files and projects will be added constantly.</em> </p>
