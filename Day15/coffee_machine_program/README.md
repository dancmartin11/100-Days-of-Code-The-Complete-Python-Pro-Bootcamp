# Coffee Machine Program

<strong>Developer: Daniel Alejandro Castillo Mart√≠n</strong>

---
<p style="text-align:justify;">This folder contains all of the scripts and resources made for the Coffee Machine project, which was part of Day 15 of the <em><strong>Udemy's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</strong></em>, developed and taught by Dr. Angela Yu. 

I fulfilled every requirement from the document found in the <em>docs</em> folder, and tried to improve its performance and structure by organizing everything in a more professional way.

<b>About this project:</b>

- The program can be executed in the <em>main.py</em> file, which executes the main program function, which can be found under the *core* folder, in the *coffee_machine.py* file.
- The *core* folder contains every essential function and module for the program's main logic.
    - The *machine_tasks.py* file contains the *MachineTasks* module, which tears the full process into smaller parts, which are later integrated in the main program function, under the *coffee_machine.py* file.
- Project instructions PDF file can be found under the *docs* folder.
- The *data* folder contains two Python files with two different dictionaries that are then imported in the *main.py* file:
    - *coin_data.py* contains a dictionary with the coins that the coffee machine supports for processing payments, each with their corresponding values.
    - *menu_data.py* contains the available drinks that the machine offer, with their corresponding details.

> <em>Note: The status of the current Bootcamp is still <b>In Progress</b>, so new files and projects will be added constantly into the main repository.</em>
